PREFACE.

An manuals of instruction on the Melodeon published up to this time do not answer the
requirements of sacred music in the Catholic churches ol America. moy are either not at all in·
tended sor ecclesiastieal music, but only 'lor the partor, -— and many of these contain exercises
-altogether foreign to the peculiar character os the instrument- or they presuppose the knowledge
of the Pione-Forte, which we are not justified to do in this country; or, finally, they are only pre-
paratory to a course on the pipe-organ, aud consequently imperfect. The large majority of our
churches and chapels have as yet no pipo-orgen, but only a melodeon. Hence our efforts this
”Theory and Praxis ol Melodoon·playing“ intended in an especial manner sor divine service, will not
be in vain3 for a long-felt want os such a book will be supplied thereby.

The lst or theoretical part of these instructions does not presuppose any knowledge ol
music; for it ” begins with the rudiment ol notation, and leads the pupil progressively to such a
degree of perfectior as every ’'organisl“ ought to attain. Moreover the most necessary information
on the structure os the instrument, on notation, keys, fingering and so forth, has been given ina
simple and concise style. Yet it will be found comprehensive enough to answer all demands ‘ola
diligent student.

'l'he 2⁶ or practical part contains a selection of over 300 short andlong piceos in all majpor
and minor keys, as well as in the old church-modeS, all of which may be used during divine
service, and as exercises. in order to aid the understauding ol music, someremarks on the most
ordinary forms of orgen-composition have been added. rho last chapter contains the liturgical
ordinances concerning the use os the organ in church.

The appendix contains the accompaniment to all responsorios ol Mass end Vespers, to all
Α presaces in the solemn and ferial tonos, to the different modes ottho psalms and their usual trans-
positions, and to the Adsperges, Vidi aquam, Veni Creator,0 salutaris, Tantum ergo -e supplement
which will prove necessary to many, desirable to all.

I am indebled to Messrs. Herzog, Oberhoffer, Piel and Mettenleiter for their kind permission
tc make use of their compositions sor, and works on the Melodeon Thanks to both composers and
publisher!
