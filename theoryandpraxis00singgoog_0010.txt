The Melodcon is a keyed instrument, externally resembling the Organ or Piano. Its tenes are
produced by the vibration of metallic reads. 'l'he latter are oblong, thin and movablc plebes of a brasslilrc
composition, having one end lixed and the other lying over, so as to be agitabed by a current of air from a
bellows. 'lhe vibrating plate (lamina or tangue) produces the tone. If the platc is long and thick at the
free end, its vibratione are lewer and its tone deep3 if the reverse, its laeter vibrations produce an acute tone.
'Phe reeds or tongues are placed in several rows on the upper part oi the bellows. 'l'he free end of every
tongue is within a narrow apertum, beneath which, in the interior of the bellows, there are salves, i c. close
lids laced with soit leather. These salves close the above-mentioned aperturos (cancelli) air-right by the pres·
sure oi springs, and they are opened by touching the keys.

A series of tongues, which corresponds to the whole number of keys on the finger-board, is called a
register. lia melodeon has one, two, three etc such complete rows oi tongues, itis accordingly called an
instrument with one, two, three etc. registers. Each register is contained in so called chambona closed up by
horizontal doors3 the chambers arc opened by drawknobs, called steps, handily adopted above the linger-board.

'Phe tongues are caused to vibrate by the in-flowing air and thus the tenes are produced. A supply
of air is forced out of the bellows, which are made to work by an alternate pressure on thc two pedale.
Ii this pressure is strong and repeated in short intervals the air is forced out with greater vehemence and
accordingly the volume ol· tone increases; if it is weak ond slew, the smaller amount oi air produces a
softer tone.

In order to direct a cmrent of air into a certain register, the corresponding stop must be pullcd
But as each register isdirided into two helvas, two stops which however bear different names, must be
pulled to open the whole registcr3 one oi these two stops is intended ior the upper keys (Trebia), the other
for the lower ones (Base). Thon, upon touching a key, the valve beneath the apertura is opened‚ the air

’ - forced out of the bellows gains access to the tongue and causes it to vibrate and sound

After these brief remarks on the construction of a melodeon, the llrst requirement is the knowledge
of the musical signs or notes, by which the keys to be touched are pointed out

Notcs are signs indicating musical sounds. They are marked on and between the lines ofa
staff which consiste oib parallel lines and 4 spaces.
