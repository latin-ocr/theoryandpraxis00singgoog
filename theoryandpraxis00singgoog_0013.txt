By measure we understand an equal division ol notes and rests. One oi the different kinds
oi notes — a minim, orotchet or quaver etc. — is set down as the unitnote. Accordingly every note οι· rest
counts as many time-parts or beata, as the unitis contained init Ii, ior instance, the orotchet is taken for

“ the unit, aSemibreve contains 4, ahiinim 2, a crotchet 1 time-part The measure is marked in the beginning

of 'a piece, next to the clef. Every measure has a certain number oi timeparts equally distributed on several
sections, which are separatedby vertical lines. Both these sections and the separating lines are called bars.

The two-quarter (crotchet) measure: ᾗ. The two-half (minim) measure: ᾗ or

the small Allabrevemeasure, also marked thus: ᾗ.

’ Β. Simple triple measuras:

'l'he three-quarter measure ᾗ. The three-eighth (quaver) measure ff.

‘The Keyhoard Names ol the Keys.

The Keyhoard consists of lower white keys and upper hlack ones. Each oi these keys is named
according to the note which is made to sound by touching iu The black keys are placed side by side in
alternate groups oi two and three Every lower key at the leit of two black keys is called c and the suh·
sequent lower keys are d e, f, y, a, h, c. Thus the names of the lower keys are repeated like the names
oi the notes.

Iret the pupil now try to lind the keys corresponding to the notes he learned thus iar. - In order
to facilitate the reading of the keys, we add a view ei the whole keyheard containing tha corresponding notes

below, and the names of the upper keys abore the finger-heard:
