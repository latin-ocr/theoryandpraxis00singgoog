Position of the Body ond Fingere. Stylo of Playing.

Let the pupil sit straight and easy in frunt of the middle οἱ the keyboard. The stool must be
high enough to level the elbows of the pluyer with the keyhourd. The upper arm should 11111111. down fi‘ee
und uneonstrsined3 the forearm should take s horizontel position. so thut the wrist, the middle of the hand,
and the first phalanges οἱ the fingers form e straight line, the middle pholo-ugos should be oblique und the
lust perpendicula, without however allowing the ueils to touch the keys. The thumb is strewhed out straight
end covers so much of the koy ss to avoid its sh'pping off. Eeoh finger should touch the surrsce of its key
exactly in'the center. Specie] Cure must he taken, lest the hands he held too high 01· slunting towards
the little singen in short, ull position: which, by the weight of the hand, render the free uction
os the fingere impossible, must be avoided. The ltnuokles should 1101 stand forth; the wrist must he
loose end flexssvle; the hands, arms ond the whole body oi* the plnyer should be in a natural and
unconstraiued position ond romain quiet and at rest as much as possible.

Let the plsyer touch the keys quietly and softly. but ut the same time firmly und without liugering.
The keys must he pressed down entirely, in order thet the tone muy sound clear und complete st ones.

The keys must be kept down exuotly os long, os the vulne of the notes demands. By Μῃονίης the
angers trom the keys mo soon, the proper connection of tones will be broken up end the music will sonnd
”mggedffl On the contrary, a slew sud tau-dy movement οἱ te fingets will cause o medley os tonos disugreeoble
to the ear. Hence the finger must allow the key w rebound with the same mcmess, ss it wus touched

'l'hs feet of the pluyor must both be engaged in moving the two pedale oontinnnlly up aud down.
Lot the feet be placed so that the heels are supported hy the brnen borders of the pedals.

The peduls must be moved alternately, but nlwuys to the botwm ot the cnse and steadily, never
nhrnptly, in order thet the tonffl produced muy be of a full and equa! volume Sudden breaks or interruptione
i.n the pressure on the pedals produce an unneturul und broken tone One foot begins its pressure on the
pedal shortly before the other has eompleted it. As soon as the 1111· is thus forced out entirely, the foot must
be et once withdrnwn, in order thet the bellows may he refflled with eir. A foster or slower aetion of the feet
produoes a stronger or sostei· tone. Before the pupss commences to pluy, he ought to lenm how to use the
pednls in a. proper manner. Unneoessury haste, half-way or even shorter movements of the pednls, md above
1111 violenoe should he cerefully avoided.
