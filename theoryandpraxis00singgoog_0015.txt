'Phe style of playing a melodeon must be, like that of an organ, strictly legato (smooth gliding),
thetis ιο say: 'Phe duration of the tones must exactly correspond to the entire valne of the notes3 therefore
the keys must be kept down neither too long nor too short a time, in order ιο avoid both an unharmonious
medley of tonos and uncalledfor breaks or interruptione.

For this purpose the proper use of the lingens, called fingering, is of the greatest importante.
The principel rulo is the following: Always have lingers free for the keys to be touched next. In
order to carry out this rule, we have to resort ιο differant modes of fingering: 1. substitution, or changing
fingens on the same key. - 2. Passing, or mering some finger over the thnmh, or the thnmb under some
finger. — 3. Slide, or moving the same finger smoothly from an upper to a lower key and rice verse, or from
one hey, blek or white. to the next. - 4. Distributition, or dividing a series of notes conveniently between
both hands. In the subsequent exerciset these directions concerning the lingering ought ιο ιο most carrefully
attended to. In order ιο accnstom the pupil to a correct fingering, the flrst part of this book contains figures
. above the notes to point out a finger of the right band, and below the notes to direct the left hand. Erery
key‚ therefore, must ιο touched by those fingers only, which are pointed ont 'l'he thumb of each hand is marked
by the figure ÷; 1 signifies the index, 2 the middle finger, 3 the ring-finger, 4 the little finger.
