Tempu.

By tempo or time we understand the rate oi movement in counting the time-parts (beatu)
of a measure. The tempo is marked in the beginning ol a piece above the upper stad, hut frequently it is
changed in the course of playing. It‘ no tempo be given, a moderately last movement is understood. Let the
pnpil count slowly in the beginning but he ought to repeat a piene so often, as to sdapt the movement to the
prescrihed tempo. The most usual terms relating to the rate of movement, are these:

Largo = broad, protracted.
Grave ² ΨΜ semus· Very slow tempo.

Lento = slow, lingering.

Ampio = slew.

Larphctto = less slew than Largo.

Amdomtc = less slew than Adagio. Slow tempo.
Audomtimo = a little tester than Andante.
Moderato = moderate.

Moestum = solemn, with grandeur.

Allapretto = somewhat lively.

Allcyro moderato = moderately fast

Allepro = lively.

Alleyro con succo = liery. Fest tempo.
Alleyro com cmo :spirited
Allcyrc assai = very lively.
Viooce = sprightly. ·
Pretio = fast.

Pretltssssimo = fastesi.

’ These indicatione ol time are often modificd by the following adverbs:

assui = very. meno = less.
molto = much, very. om poco = a little.
troppo = very. pio mom or cnosso = more lively.

A gradual acceleration of movement is indicated thus:

accelerando = growing fasten and iaster.
cremento = urging onward.
piu atrato = hasiening.

A gradual transition into a slower movement is signifled by such terms as:

rotomum (rit.) = holding back. calamato = decreasing in movement and volume ol tone. '⁹

attercando (mitond) = slackening. u tempo or tempo primo = former strict time.
rollentomdo (rotent.) = slower and slower. l'c'steoco tempo = the sometime.

Since, however, these indicatione ol tium ure rather vegue and liable to divers interpretatione, the rate
ol movement is more erectly determined by Maelzel's time-measurer, called Metronome (Μ. Μ. means

Machel’s Metronome). The pendulum ol this instrument may be enjusmd hya sliding weight, which, ζ
