according to its place on a scale ot 160 dogmas, causes the pendulum to vibrato fasten or slower. If, for
instance, the sliding weight (nut) is placed ‘on 60⁰, the pendulum makes 60 swings in a minuta and each owing

χ '3 points ont thc dmation of the unitnote. The following figures indicate tho different rates of movement
'‘ approximatoly:

11 M. J: 60 (60 crotchets in a minuta) lor tho slowest movement
„ „ J: 60 (60 „ „ ,‚ „ )for tho slew movement.

o η J= 90 (90 ,, ,, ,,. ,, )1ὀ1 the moderatolyfast movement.

„ „ J=120 (120 ,, ,, ,, ,, )for the fast movement

η ,, 41 = 145-160.(145-160 ‚, „ ‚‚ ,‚ lfor the fastest movemant

We soe from this, that each one of the above movements has a composa ol several degroes; e. g. the
slow tempo has 30⁰, since tho moderatcly fast tempo begins wito the 90o degree. The exact rate ol move·
ment is flxed by the character of the pieco.
