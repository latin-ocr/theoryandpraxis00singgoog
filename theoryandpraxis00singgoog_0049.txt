Dolce = softly, sweetly. Oootcbde = iu 8 melodicus, flowing style
Risoluto = firmly.

These various degrees of force iu music are to the ear that which light aud shade iu pointing are to
the eye. It requires indeed grem care and patience to give due attention to this variety of dynamical degrees‚
yet, by ueglectiug them we deprive music of its beanty aud efficaoy.

The following directiorm are to show how the pupil ought to perform a pisce dynamically correct.

1. A 1881 movemeut 81 the pedale produces 8 lond tone, 8 slow movement a 8811 tone. Add to mm
that the playiug of 8 passage consisting of full chords requires 8 greater quantity of air and consequeutly a

' fast movemeut 81 118 peduls.

2. The Crescendo is produced by moriug the pedals gradually 188188, 1188 Decreaoendo, by moviug the
pedals gradually slower.

1188181 118 Amercan melodeons have a socelled swell‚ which is attached above the pedals as high as
the kuee of the player. Upon pressing the knee against the swell‚ the volume 81 118 tone is gradually iu·
cresscd, provided that, 8111888888 time, the pedals are moved fastor. rue proper use of the swell requires
careful exercise, es every pressura of the kuee more or less strong produces at once an audible change in the
volume 81 tone. Thereforq the pupil must try and try again to move the pedals aud 118 swell iu such a

. manner, that 8 smooth and even tone is produced. For this reason, the pressura on the swell as well 88 ou

the pedals must 18 quiet aud even, aud it must he repeated fast or slow according 18 118 required volume of
tone. This exercise must be repeated again and again, until the pnpil is able to sustain a cho‘rd iu all degrses
. of force 88 long as 18 wauts. - Begiu with playing the following notes first p, then pp, nafis.
