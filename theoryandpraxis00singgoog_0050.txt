Now, let the same exercise he repeated with some additional stops and finally with all stops. Many
melodeoue¹ principally larger ones, are furnished with a mechaniam similar to the swell on the opposite side.
It yields olso to a pressure of the left knee and thus opens all registers at once, while the stops remain un·
touched. Suohamechanism is called Grand Organ. Other instrumente have a special stop for the same pmpose

It would he well to repeat the previous exercises with an application of dynamioal signs, as they are
given in the subsequent pieces.

It may not he superfluous to remark here, that the use of the swell should not he tmned into an abuse
hy applying it constantly and without any reason whatsoever. 'lhat would he mawkish affectatiom a style of
playing which means nothing and diegusts the hearer, especially during divine service. A judicious ohsemance
of dynamics infusos, as it were asoul into the liseless notes, and therefore, it cannot he called sentimentality.
