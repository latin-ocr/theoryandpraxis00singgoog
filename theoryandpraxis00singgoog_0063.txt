1110101 sufficient to perform a composition technically correct, but the main requisite 01 an
artistic performance is the understanding and appreciation 01 the beauties contained in a composition. Hence
1110 performer must endeavor to penetrate into the spirit of a composition, to comprehend the ideas and the
individual feeling of the composer, and to reproduce them in his own performance with all the means at his
disposal. This faculty cannot be taught; it requires musical talent and a fine taste, which alone will
enable the performer 10 study and finally comprehend the ideas expressed in a composition In short, 111010
001101 be taught by drilling, but by developing that gift of nature which we call musical
talent. The various emotions of the composer are intimated principally by 1110 0001101111θο 011110 key,
tempo and dynamical niceties (shading), as well as by 1110 different timbres of sonnd and their com·
binations. In 0110110 1101100101ὴο proper meaning ofa composition, and to facilitate the artistic performance,
modern composers are wont to add numerous directions for the performer, such as tempo, dynamics etc. The
pupil ought to observa these indicatione accurately, in order 10 reproduce 111οι composers work completely
in 1110 own performance. On tempo and dynamics we have already given the necessary information. But there
is another means of 1110 greatest importunae 101 an 11110110 performance, a means by which the performer is
enabled to produce a great variety of timbres and combinatione thereof on the melodeon and, to a still greater
extent, on 1110 organ: it is the Judicions use and testeful combination 01 the different registers.

11011010ῗο 011 Stops.

It is a grem mistako 10 judge from the number 01 stops, that there must be an equal number of
registers 01 0010 01 10010. The long row of stops are but too often a mere show and swindle‚ by which
people who haue no insight, are imposed upon. 110100101001110000010110010, corresponding ·to the
compass of the hey-board, has two stopa Besides, 1110101110 stops which do not cause any change of timbre,
but only a slight increase in 1110 volume of 00111 ” ’

According to tho different pitches of sound, we speah 01 eightfoot, four-foot, twofootssixteenfoot
stops. The 811. stops produce the normal pitch 01 sound, the lowest 00111 being F 01 tha 00111101 octave
