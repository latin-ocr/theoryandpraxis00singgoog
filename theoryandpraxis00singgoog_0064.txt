(on instrumente witha compass of only four octavos it is great C); every key sonnds the piteh indeed
by the note. tft. stopa make the keys sound one octava higher than indicated by the notes; afr. stops two
octavos higher, and 16lt. stops one octave lower. Hence if eft stops are to produce the same pitoh as stt.
stopa, those keys which are one octave lower than indicated by the notes, must be touched; with 1611. stops,
one octavo higher. The list below contains the stops in common nse, together with their pitohes as we lind
them on melodeous with one keyboard.

Thoso who have the means to procure an instrument with two rows of keys, called, mannals anderen

dmability surpasses tho largest melodeon.

dombinjion of stops.

By combination oi stops we mean the art oi selecting the proper mixture ol stops forthe sake oi
producing a certain timbre ol sonnd It is, certainly, a matter of careinl study to make such combinatione as
anit the peculiar character oi a piece. As a ruls, the pentormer must pull two stops belonging together at a
time. For mere accompaniment, those stopa producing soit tones will auswer best Both the pulling and the
pushing oi stops ought to be done skillfnlly and onickly, and, as much as possible, by force of the lingens only.

Iu compositions for the melodeon, the stopa wanted are frequently indicated by the initials enclosed
in parenthesim e. g. (D) = Diapason, (Μ) = Melodia, (Fu) = Flnte, and so forth. When these indicatione
have an oblique stroke across them, they signify the closing or pushing back of the respective stop,
a g. (D) denotas the olosing ol Diapason, the same is indicated by the initials enclosed in brackets, e. g. [11].
uncae indicatione marked over tlre upper staff are intended for tlte treble, those under the lower staff for the

base, and those between the two staves lor both treblo and basa.
