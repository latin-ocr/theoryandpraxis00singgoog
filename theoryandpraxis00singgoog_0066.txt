Proseruation of the instrument Repeirs

'Phe melodeon may be injured by damp westher, draught, dry hest, and dust Therefore, the instru-
ment ought not ιο stand near a stowe, nor close ιο a damp wall, nor in a place which exposes it ιο the rays
of the sun. The stops must be closed, in order ιο keep the dust from the reads. Care must be taken not to
injure the instrument by a violent and abrupt pressure on the pedals end heys. Occasional disturbantes of the
immanens should be attended to and repaired without delay. Many deas may be easily repaired.

Ila key souuds without being touched, the corresponding valve does not close the apertura admitting
air to the angue. The causes of this defect may be as follows: The key is presented from rebounding by
friction. 1 know cases where, in consequence of damp westher, the frume in front of the hey-board was bent
a little towards the heys, which ou this account were presented from rebounding. A slight abrasion of the
hume removed the obstacle. — Frequently also the valve does not close the apertura air-tight, because it is
covered with dust, or because the spring attached to the valve has lost part oi its elasticity. Sometimes the
spring is detached from the valve by striking the keys too violently, or the walveia stopped by a small nail
close by it, especially when it opens too far. In many such cases we can easily readjnst the valve by repeated
short touches of the key3 generally, however, we have ιο open the chamber, (every one ought ιο have this '
explained by the manufacturer or merchant, when he buys the instrument) in order to readjust the valve.

If a tongue does not sound, brush the dust from it. Open the chamber, pull out the tongue with
the iucised wire, which is found in every instrument, put a slip of paper under it, and clean it with a soft
brnsh. Do all this carefdly and the tongue will mund again.

roe tongues are put out of tune either by dua orbyabreak. Intheformercaseclean the ¹

tongra, in the latter buy a new oue. In ordering a new tangue give the name or number of the instrument,
or at least the name of the register, note and octava In order ιο be sure oi harag the tangue tnned well,
send the tongue next ιο it along with the order.

'l'he rattling oia tongue occurs, wheu itis loose aud its edges are exposed ιο friction, - which
rarely happens. Pnll cut the angue and tile the edges a little, but so as not ιο break it.

As to the rest, is is adwisable ιο consult a manufacturer of instrumente in order not to make the

iudury worse.

ldodulation

By modulatior we understand the transition from one key into another. The art of modulating
forms part of Harmony, the study of which is indispensably necessary ιο complete the musical training of an
orgmist. Yet, since a good many of our organista, notwithstanding the great number of good mannals of
ninneton ou this point, find no opportunity of mahng a thorough course in Harmony, Ihcue deemed it
adwsable ιο append a synopsis of very brief and simple modulatione horn all keys into all keys, in order ιο
leesea somewhat the hequent and gross mistakes made in modulating. Each modulation is followed by a short
esdenca which is to make the transition into the new key satisfactory and pleasing ιο the musical ear. Let
the pupil commit them to memoryl Ἴ

All accidentale in parenthesis are to be observed only when the modulation is to be made from one

mluor key into another. In this case, all other notes are ιο be played according to the signatura given for
. the maior key.
