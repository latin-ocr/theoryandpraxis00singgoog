Second Part.

a. aa.
A brief survey cf the Forma of Orgaucompositions.

There are in music, according ιο the analogy cf language, various forms cf expressiug, cr modes

“ of exhibiting musical ideas. Every composition consisto of several movemeuts (these again of perioda, sections,

phrases, and so forth) which, according to their different number, arrangement and connection, constitute dif-

, ferent stylos aud forms.

A. The homophonous style, in which the priucipal idea of the piace is expressed by cue part, while the
others are subordinate to, aud form the accompauimeut of the cue main part

B. The polyphonic style, in which all parts, cr at least more thau one are coordinate, i a they have
each their own melodic development aud parteke equally cf the ideas expressed by the whole; hence
each part is an aasential or real part of the whole

The homophonous style is more simple and easier to comprehend, whereas the polyphonic style is more
expressive and more thoroughly penetrated by the muscal idea of a composition.

Both styles are employed in sacred music

The priucipal forms of the polyphonic style are:

1. Imitatiou. A motivo, i. e. amodel, consisting of two or more tonas, isrepcated in cna part, while '

that part which introduces the model, continues its own melody. If the imitation retains tha same
· degrees of tone, aud the same progressiou of intervals, it is termed strict imitation. Free imi·
tatione, however, are those, in which the model is repeated on differem degrees aud iu slightly
changed intervals
Examples of imitation are found among the preceding exercises aud, especially, among the subsequeut
compositicus of those mediaeval-masters who are reucwned for their unsurpassed skill in working out a
theam (thematic work)2 May their worhs be studied with exceeding diligeuoe and perseverance.

, 2. The Canon Each part contains exactly the same motiva, which, however, is beguu in different bars,
or, at least, on different timeparts oia bar.

3. 'dhe Fugue, a compositionis which a longer motiva, called theme, is imitated by all parts in a suc-
cessiou, determincd by the precepts of musical aasthetics After the first passage, a second oue fol·
lows, connected with the first by au episcde. In the second passage, the theme frequently appears‘in
divers melodic and rhythmis alterations: inverted, augmented or diminished. Towards the end of a fugua,

’ all parts repeat the theme in close successicu, that is to say, oue part sets in before the preceding part
has finished the theme: this is called a close passage( It is generally executed on the socalled
orgen-point, i. e. on a sustained tone in the basa-part. Cfr. No. 195. A Fughetta or short fugae
contains only one passage cf the thema Cir. Nc. 70.

The priucipal form of the homophonous style is the song-form, which consiste of oue or two periods;
each period containing two phrases ahin to each other. - Another form of the homophonous style is
the variation

A Prelude is along or short introductory composition ιο another movement (e. g. fugue), song, or
action. The character and hey of preludes must agree with the following movement or with tho character of
afeast. The same must be said about postludes aud interludes, Versetto (strophe) is a term fior those
interludes, which are ιο supply those parts of a song which are not sung by the choir.

Toccata is a composition without strict form, something like a fantasia, containing long-sustained
ohords set to a lively figuraticu. '

Here follow some longer aud more difficult compositione.
