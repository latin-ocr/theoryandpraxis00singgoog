The ancient Ghurohnodes.
ln the peculiar chent of the Ohurch, called Gregorian‚ or Plain chart, there are not only two¹

diatonic scales, the major and minor scales of modern music, bnt each one of the seven constituent tonos of ’

the scale may be taken as the first, or tonic. Hence we distinguish seven scales different from one another
by the position of the semitones. The knowledge of these scales is indispenssbly necessary for the orgsnist,
herenae he has to accompany the melodias of plain chent, and furnish prelndes end interludes in the same
mode.. It is for this resson, that we append a synopsis of the scales and modes, and selection of short and

easy compositione in all modes. Moreover, these compositione afford en opportunity of studying this style of Ι

music, end of edniring‚ ewen in shortest passages, the musicd ert and genius displaysd hy the composers.
