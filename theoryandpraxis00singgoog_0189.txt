e g. on the feasts of St. Mathias, St. Thomas Aquinas, St Gregory the Great, St Joseph, Annunciation ottho

4) Whenever the Bishop 11 111 diocese enters a chnrch in solemn processior 111111 to perform the
divine service in person orto assist, and when he, afterwards, leaves the chnrch, it is becoming to play the
organ. Likewisc, at the solemn entrance of a Papal Envoy, (lardiinl, Archbishop or Bishop of another diocese, ⁴
whom 11 oranny osnes o honor, 11 orgen suono oc prayer, unm 1111111111 11111 propos anu
the service is to commence.

6) At Matius, Mass and Vespera, the first and the last strophe or verses 11 Hymns and (lauticlcs, as
weh as those atrophos or verses at which a genuflection is to 11 made, e. g. ”Te ergo quaesumus“ in the 'l'e
Deum, ’'Tantum ergo“, when the Blessed Sacrament is exposed, and others, should 11 sung by the choir with
a distinct pronunciation 11 the words, but not merely supplied by the orgen. The same rnle applica to the

”Gloria Patri‘, even though the verse or strophe immediately preceding has been sung by the choir.
· 1) At other Canonical Honrs, which are recited in choro, it is not customary to employ the organ.
But 11 such a custom exist anywhere, tho play ths orgen, for instance, at the 'lierce especially when the
Bishop, at the same tim'e, puts ou the sacred vestments, 111 custom may be kept up. Yet, it must be borne in
mind that those parts which are not sung, but merely supplied by the organ, are to 11 distinctly recited by
one 11111 chanters. It is commendable that the organ should accompany the chanters recitet

8) At Solemn Vespere, the organ is usually played aiter every psalm, aud alternately at the Hymns
and the ”Magnificat“, the above mentioned noles being strictly observed.

10) At the Credo, however, it is forbidden to supply alternate parts by the orgen, bnt it must be
distinctly sung by the choir from beginning to end.

. melodice and harmonias, far hom being profane or indecorous, agree with the character of the divim service;
other instruments beside the organ should nothe employed.

12) Likewisc, both the singcrs aud musicians should take precautions, lest their singing which is
intended to promote piety, savonr 11 levity or wantonness; let the music 11 such as not 11 divert 1111ιί111 11
the listencrs hom prayer and pious contemplatione, 1111111 devont, clear and intelligiblc.

Chant which is also proper for the seasons 11 advent and Lent Α precept to this effect refers especially to
the time from the 52¹l Sunday 11 Lsnt to hlaster, except Manndy Thursday and Holy Satnrday. 1. nanc. 114
