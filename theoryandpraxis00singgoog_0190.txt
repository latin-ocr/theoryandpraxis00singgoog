Time end egain we arc esked: Is tho Gregorien chent 111 be accompanied by the orgen? Iret 111
question be enswered in whatever wey, one thing is certain, there is no ecclesiastical decision against such
accompanimcnt Considering the question from its historical end musical stand-points, any end every kind 11
11111111111111 is to be rejected es an anachronistic and incongrnous additamentum. 'Phe Gregorien chent
was conceived as mere melodico inspired by the secred text, end not founded on certain hermonic tone com·
binations on which modern hermony is built; 111 harmony in the modern sense 11111 therm was unknown 11
the ancient world For that reason any harmonization oi the Gregorien chent will always constituto en
unwerranteblo garb marring its peculias beenties 111111 than presenting them in their proper light. ⁵

From a practice] point 11 view, however, 1 belitting accompanimcnt by the orgen will recommend 111111,
11 11 111 assisting the execution 11 111 chent, bc it on account of the pencity 11 singers, be it to prevent
tiresomeness on the part of the 1111111111 and to steedy their voices, or 111 producing variety, always affording
ploesure aud delight. At all events tha accompanimcnt mnst be in keoping with· the characteristic peculiarities
11 111 ancient chnrch tonalities thet differ essentielly from our modern major end minor keys3 it is never allowed
to deviato irom the melodia nature 11 11111111 its only obJ'ect being the elucidation 11111 melody ensuring
an easy end flowing declamation oi the sacred text. — Though it may 11 allowed to accompany the Prciace
end Pater noster still it woudd 11 better 11 1111 them, hom both musical and practicel consideratione. It not
unheqncntly happens that the oiiioiating priest siugs them incorrectly, orbis voice is faulty3 in such ceses en

accompanimcnt 111 cover many sins agomst 111111111 and beenty 11111 chent, still the dissonmces caused Ψ

willharshly grate on the ears 11 the hearers. 01 the contrary, is the Profecc sung correctly end with a sonorous
voice, many niceties will 11 destroyed; for 1) the orgen-tono is oi en uncouth and much less supple nature then
tho human voice; 2) Are the chenters - the priest and the organist — 11 111 great 1 distance es to make it
possible ior both to proceed simulteneonsly‚ as we 111 know from experience. In this wisc, melody end hermony

are cleshing end the effect iar from producing en effect to ediiy the congregations or 11 enhance their devotion.

Moreover the Proface should always be snng ”intelligibili voce“, which is rendered impossible if tha
orgen accompanimcnt is too lond, finally, 1 temporary pause on the part 11 111 organistis 1 veriteble recrea·
tion, more conducivo to 1111 devotion then en nncessent dinning 11 sound, more particularly at a moment when
the otiering priest intones that sublime, mejestic hymnus requiring 11111111 mind 11 which 1 daed instru-
ment, like the orgen, by no means can do jnstice. From all theseconsideretions‚ itis evident that the orgen
accompanimcnt would better 11 omitted than execntcd: better none than incorrectness and inevitable diversion.

conceive 11 an organist to whom both tonality and melody 11 the Prefece ere unknown qneutities,
accompanying the officieting priest with an orgen only in rere cases in time, how is it possible for the priest - -
to sing it correctly? Or 111 organist is running up end down 111 keyboard es 1111 1 rege, what kind of
nerves must the priest possess in order to proceed ¹composedly with a melody the most solemn, sublime, simple,
greve end 11111 In such instances 111 only remedy is an imperative: ''Organum non pulsetnr“ — the orgen

shall not be pleyod. 11, however, en accompanimcnt is desirable, well, let it 11 111 correctly contrived, tone· ’

1111 in consonance with the nature 11 the melody, sustaining the voice 11 111 prisonem doing' 1111 justice to
text and melody.

In this sense the harmonizations must be taken. Respeoting tha execution 11 111 orgen part wc will
merely state, 1) thet only soit stops (8⁴) are to be drawn, by means 11 which the priest will keep the proper
pitch, bis voice will 11 sustained end not drowned The orgen is but to serva end not to dominssr, the former
to be donc in tho most discrcet manner. — 2) 'Pho accompanimcnt is to be executed fluently in order not to
impede the declamation 11111 text Hence the Orgenist always ought to bc gnided by the chent 11 111 alter.
11 the priest evinces any inclinatior to lletten his voice, a little mors poweriul stop will restore his proper
pitch instantly. The question as 11 what chord should be tha 111111111111111111111111111111111111111.
In es much es the following ”Sanctus“ is intimetcly connected with the Preiece, the chord to be pleyed will
11 either major or minor, according tho the incipient chord 11111 Sanctus. - ’111 responsas should be taken

from the Romen missal and sung in nnison by choir and congregation ’111 Antiphones, by which tho
